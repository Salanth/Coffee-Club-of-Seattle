## No Show Policy
Many of our venues and events are limited in size, so we need to restrict the number of RSVPs. **We strive to get near 100% turnout to every event.** Occasionally, we will get a new member that is a repeated No Show. They hold a slot and prevent another member from attending. That is not fair. 

#### To deal with NO SHOWS, the Leadership of the Coffee Club of Seattle reserves the right to: 

1. Remove the Member from the Mailing List.
2. Remove the Member from the group. 

Some members sign up for more events than they plan to attend. They hold a slot and then wait until the last minute to cancel. If it happens repeatedly, they will also be Removed. 

**Please update your RSVP to NO as soon as your realize you will be unable to attend an event.**
